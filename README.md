# Python Basics for Automation

## 📌 Purpose
This repository is created to demonstrate my understanding of
basic programming concepts and how Python can be used in
industrial automation and system maintenance contexts.

## 🧠 What I am learning
- Variables and data types
- Conditional logic (if/else)
- Loops (for/while)
- Simple file and data handling
- Problem-solving mindset

## 🛠 Example use cases
- Analyzing simple sensor logs
- Automating repetitive checks
- Understanding control logic through code

## 📈 Progress
- Day 1: Variables and basic input/output (planned)
- Day 2: Conditional logic
- Day 3: Loops
